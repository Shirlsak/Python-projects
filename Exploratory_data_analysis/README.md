This is a simple Exploratory data analyis project, to analyse and explore the FitBit Data from Kaggle. 
The project contains the following steps:
* Data cleaning/preprocessing: a basic clean up and preparation was done by checking for missing values, duplicates and checking
  to see if the data was ready for the analysis.
* Univariate Analysis: histograms were used to visualize and examine each column to understand the characteristics and patterns in the numerical features.
* Bivariate Analysis: the relationship between the target variable(Calories) and the features were examined using scatterplots, boxplots, line charts and correlation map.
* Feature Importance:The importance of each feature in predicting the Calories was visualised using a random forest model to understand how each feature in the data contributed to predicting target varaible (Calories)
